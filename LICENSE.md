# GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
## Version 3, 29 June 2007

Copyright (C) 2024 Guilherme Evangelista Ferreira dos Santos

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

## Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works. The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GPL aims to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a projectâ€”to make sure it remains free software for all its users.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it. These responsibilities mean you must license your derivative works on the same terms as the original software, and you must ensure that the source code is made available.
